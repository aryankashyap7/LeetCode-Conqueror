The most optimized approach for solving the "Integer Break" problem is based on a mathematical observation and is both simple and efficient. The goal of this approach is to break the integer n into as many factors of 3 as possible while ensuring that the remaining part is either 1 or 2. Let's break down how this approach works:
​
First, we handle some special cases:
​
If n is 2, the optimal product is 1, so we return 1.
If n is 3, the optimal product is 2, so we return 2.
For values of n greater than 3, we aim to maximize the product by breaking it down into factors of 3.
​
We use a while loop to iteratively subtract 3 from n and multiply the product by 3 in each iteration. We continue this loop until n becomes less than or equal to 4.
​
When n is less than or equal to 4, we stop the loop because further breaking it into factors of 3 won't result in a greater product. At this point, we have one of the following scenarios:
​
n is 4, so we can break it into 2 * 2, resulting in a product of 4.
n is 2 or 3, and we simply multiply it by the remaining value of product.
Finally, we return the calculated product, which represents the maximum product achievable by breaking n into factors of 3 as much as possible.
​
Here's a simple example to illustrate how this approach works:
Let's say n is 10. The loop would iterate as follows:
​
First iteration: n becomes 7, and the product becomes 3 (3 * 3).
Second iteration: n becomes 4, and the product becomes 9 (3 * 3 * 3).
Third iteration: n becomes 1, and the product becomes 27 (3 * 3 * 3 * 3).
The loop stops because n is now less than or equal to 4.
The final product is 27, which is the maximum product achievable by breaking 10 into factors of 3 as much as possible.
This approach is highly efficient with a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1) because it doesn't involve any loops or data structures that depend on the input size. It simply leverages a mathematical pattern to calculate the result directly based on the value of n.
