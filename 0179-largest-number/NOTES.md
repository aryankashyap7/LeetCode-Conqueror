​
The code aims to create the largest possible number by concatenating the elements of a given vector of integers. While the code is functional, there are some flaws and areas for improvement:
​
Comparison for Concatenation:
The main issue in this code is that it sorts the numbers as strings using the default lexicographical comparison, which doesn't guarantee the correct ordering for forming the largest number. For instance, if you have numbers like [3, 30, 34], sorting them will give [3, 30, 34], but the largest number should be 34330.
​
Custom Comparator:
To address the above issue, a custom sorting comparator should be used. The custom comparator should compare the concatenation of two numbers in both orders and choose the order that yields the larger result.
​
Zero Handling:
If there are multiple zeros in the input array, the current code doesn't handle their placement correctly. For example, [0, 0, 0] should result in "0" instead of "000".
